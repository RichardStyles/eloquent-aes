## Introduction

This package allows for your Eloquent Encryption to be encrypted using a different AES-256-CBC key. This allows for your regular app:key to be [rotated](https://tighten.co/blog/app-key-and-you/). If you're looking for 4096-RSA encruption then this package [RichardStyles/EloquentEncryption](https://github.com/RichardStyles/EloquentEncryption)

## Installation

This package requires Laravel 8.x or higher.

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require richardstyles/eloquent-aes
```

If you wish to change the key cipher then you will need to publish the config.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="RichardStyles\EloquentAES\EloquentAESServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

To create an Eloquent encryption key, just as you would an app key. This will automatically add to the bottom of your `.env` file.

```bash
php artisan key:eloquent
```

### ⚠️ Please don't forget to back up your eloquent key
If you re-run this command, you will lose access to any encrypted data!


## Usage

This package leverages Laravel's own [custom casting](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators#custom-casts) to encode/decode values.

``` php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use RichardStyles\EloquentAES\Casts\AESEncrypted;
use RichardStyles\EloquentAES\Casts\AESEncryptedCollection;
use RichardStyles\EloquentAES\Casts\AESEncryptedObject;

class SalesData extends Model
{
    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'private_data' => AESEncrypted::class,
        'private_collection' => AESEncryptedCollection::class,
        'private_object' => AESEncryptedObject::class,
    ];
}

```

There are additional casts which will cast the decrypted value into a specific data type. If there is not one that you need, simply make a PR including sufficient testing.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
